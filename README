OVERVIEW
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
libpopt provides implementations of a handful of commonly used
gradient-based numerical optimization algorithms.  The implementation
currently includes:

* Stochastic gradient descent
* LBFGS (J. Nocedal, 1980. Quasi-Newton Matrices with Limited Storage)
* Rprop (M. Riedmiller, 1994. Rprop - Description and Implementation Details)

The implementations are somewhat spare in terms of functionality, but the
optimizer state can be serialized and persisted between function
evaluations, making it possible to run different optimization steps in
different processes or even on different machines (binary compatibility
between the platforms is assumed).


TODO
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* provide alternative convergence tests
* add richer interfaces to support algorithms that require more than simply
  f(x) and f'(x).
  - stochastic meta descent
  - conjugate gradient descent
  - LBFGS with l-1 regularization
* better support for online learning methods
  - algorithms should know if they support online methods
  - online methods should (probably) support dynamic numbers of variables
